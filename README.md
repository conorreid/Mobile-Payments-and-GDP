# Mobile-Payments-and-GDP
This is a project trying to see if there is a link between the use of mobile payments and GDP growth by reigon. 

GDP Data is from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/download.aspx)
Mobile Payment User Data comes from Statista (http://www.statista.com/statistics/279957/number-of-mobile-payment-users-by-region/)
